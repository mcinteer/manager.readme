## My Leadership Philosophy 
I believe we need to encourage trust within our team so everyone is comfortable challenging and being challenged. We need to do all we can to continuously improve how we do what we do. For example, I want to to see us trying new things all the time. They might fail, but lets give it a go and see if it works. Being comfortable to challenge the current state of play is key to this. I want to create this kind of culture and believe the way we'll get there is through open, honest and transparent communication. I endevour to be kind in all my interactions without shying away from any hard truths. 



## My expectations of folks who report to me
I expect buy in on a few levels, firstly I need you to buy into our 1:1's. They work a lot better if we both do some preparation for them, even if you just spend 10 minutes reflecting on the time since our last one and jot down a few thoughts. Further to this, please do raise any challenges or problems you are facing. I want to know about these opportunities to improve.

I also expect you to buy in to what we're trying to achieve as a team, whatever that might be. If you don't buy into what we're building, or how we are building it then lets talk about why that is and see if we need to change something.

I would rather not have surprises crop up, so please send me information if you think it's relevant. For example, I'd rather be told something 10 times than not at all. Over-communicating is better than under-communicating for me. 

I expect you to tell me about the things you would like to do. For example, if you want to improve your public speaking, tell me and I can find an audience for you. If you want to improve your tech skills in a different area, tell me and I'll do my best to find something in that space for you to work on. Is interviewing a skill you want to improve? I can find that experience for you.


## What you can expect of me as your manager
My default cadence for 1:1's is every 2 weeks, this might be too much or not enough for you. The cadence of these is dictated by you, if you want them more or less frequently, let me know and we'll make it so. My only caveat is that I'm not comfortable with more than a month passing between 1:1's.

I intend to communicate clearly and never leave you thinking about what I might actually mean. I don't want you to make assumptions about what I've said. If anything is unclear, please ask questions because it will be a mistake on my part and I will try and clear it up.

Change. I will try a lot of new things, some of these will not work and we'll stop doing them. Others will improve our teamwork, process, communication or something else and we'll keep doing them. I want our team to be comfortable with change and the idea of trying things out. The goal here is Continuous Improvement.

I will provide you with an environment that encourages constructive thinking in the hope that it will assist you in finding innovative ways to solve problems. I want to empower you to find solutions yourself, yet provide enough support so you're not overwhelmed by the problems we'll face on a daily basis.

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")

### What makes you grumpy?

- When you say one thing and do something else. I will get grumpy if I feel you have not lived up to your word. If you say you'll do something, I expect you to do your best to make it so. An honest attempt is all I can ask, I have no problem if you don't complete it as long as you've given it your best effort.


### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

- I will generally not say much and bottle it up. If I'm quiet for an extended period then it's possible a good signal that I'm grumpy.


### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

- Coffee/Beer/Food, generally going for a good chinwag over a drink or food will alleviate my bad mood. Any distraction will probably help, these are a few of my favorites though. 


### How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

- I'm just happy to receive feedback, anyway you're comfortable giving it, I'm comfortable receiving it.


### How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

- As it happens. I'm a pretty chilled and informal person.


### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

- Depends, if the recognition is just for me, then I'd rather receive it privately. If it's recognition for a group I'm apart of, public would be okay.


### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

- Getting to know people. Its great to takle the work stuff and remove any problems or obsticals. But I enjoy the human aspect of them more. For example hearing about something cool you did one the weekend or sharing something I've done. Even better, talking about the next great adventure you've got planned. That being said, I get real satisfaction out of helping you develop. So share your pet projects or your long/short term goals with me and I'll do my best to help you with them.


### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

- Lets start with the next three months. Being new to this role, I'd like to settle into being the Team Lead. To me that means a number of things, for example:
	- Being comfortable leading and facilitating team discussions;
	- Presenting ideas to the team and externally, and;
	- Getting to know what makes you tick and finding out how I can assist. 
- I'd like to look back in three months time and be able to say that I've helped our team try new things, fail, succeed, and try something new again.
- I don't expect to do much hands on Engineering over the next 3 months. I want to concentrate on getting the team firing on all cylinders and helping you.
- Looking out to the rest of the year, I'd like to get back to engineering. I don't ever want to stop crafting this skill.
- One main goal I want to achieve is to remove distractions and blockers for our team to allow us to build, maintain and support the best systems we can.
- I'd also like to improve the communication our team has, both internally amongst ourselves and externally. It'd be great to be able to share some of the awesome things that we've been able to create, and conversly, it'd be great to be able to reuse some awesome things created from elsewhere in the business.


### What do you need from your manager?

- Coffee/Beer/Food. For when I'm grumpy. Oh, and trust, trust is key.


### From your team?

- Opportunity to foster trust. I ask that you give me the opportunity to build trust and develop a good relationship through open and honest communication. If I fail to do that, that's on me. The opportunity is all I can ask.
- Feedback. I want to know when I've done something to upsets you (or someone else). I'm not going to get grumpy if you tell me I'm doing something bad/wrong/good/stoopid. I geniunely want this information. I can't fix it if I don't know it's broken


### From your peers? (outside the team)

- Communication! I want transparency, especially from within Platform Engineering. We all have common goals and I want us to work together where appropriate to achieve them. 


### What’s your favourite baked good?

- Savoury for me. Saussie rolls are gold.
